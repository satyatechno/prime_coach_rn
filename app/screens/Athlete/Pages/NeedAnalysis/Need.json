                    "point": "Tennis is a racket sport that can be played in a ‘singles’ or ‘doubles’ format. The aim of the sport is to propel a ball over or around a net into the opponent’s court. If the ball is not properly returned, a point is awarded to the opposing player(s). Thus, the objective is to play the ball in such a way to make it difficult for the opponent to return it successfully (Lees, 2003). The sport is characterised by high-intensity actions, interspersed with low-intensity actions and recovery periods. These occur in-between points and breaks in play (Fernandez-Fernandez, et al, 2014). Tennis demands a number of fitness components, including agility, power, speed, as well as enhanced aerobic fitness due to the potential duration of a match (Kovacs, 2006)."
